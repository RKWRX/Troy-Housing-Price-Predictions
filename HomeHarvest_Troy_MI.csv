You have just found it in this Troy ranch with nearly 2, 000 square feet of living space on the first floor. This property features an attached garage with direct access to the home, a first floor laundry room, four bedrooms, one full and two half bathrooms (with the possibility of expanding the Half bath in the primary bedroom to a full bath). One of the unique features of this property is that the property has a full basement underneath the entire home. The basement also features an extra tall ceiling making it very functional for the next owner. This property is in need of updating and has the original decor and fixtures throughout. Because this home has every room on the same level on the first floor (no step down on to a cement slab in the family room) the possibilities are endless including removing walls and making a great room encompassing the existing kitchen, living room, dining room and family room. The property needs renovations throughout. This might be a perfect fit for someone looking for an affordable property in this neighborhood and is willing to do sweat equity. If you can not find a house that meets your design tastes, this property is a blank slate for you to renovate into your dream home. This would also make an excellent rental.
